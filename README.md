# Simulated Smarthome Dashboard

This project demonstrates a smarthome dashboard built using react and chakra for ui. The dashboard data is fetched from a simulated smarthome server that periodically updates data. The primary goal is to learn more about website design and functionality through making a dashboard, as well as working with, parsing, and presenting a large amount of data.
